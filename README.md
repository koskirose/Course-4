# Course-4 The Task:
I have exciting news. We have been contacted by a law firm that needs help analyzing archived data records for their client. Although we don’t know the full details, it seems that their client claims to have not been occupying a specific residence at the time of an undisclosed event during the Summer of 2008.

The lead attorney is compiling several evidentiary proof points that supports the client’s claim. As part of this effort, we have been asked to obtain and analyze the residential electrical power usage data from 2007 to 2010.

Specific questions from the law firm:

What information is contained within the data records?
Is the data complete? Is anything missing?
What are the typical power usage patterns for this residence?
Are these “typical” patterns true for the time period in question?
If not, what, if anything, can be used to help support the client’s claims?
Are there any outliers or events depicted in the data that may undermine the client’s claims?
Are there any recommendations for questions we should be asking?
Is any additional information needed from the law firm to conduct the analysis?
The lead attorney has given us access to a database containing 47 months of power usage data. Our job over the next few weeks will be to analyze this data to determine what kind of analytics and visualizations can be created that would help prove or disprove the client’s claims. Needless to say, this is an important project and learning the truth could have serious repercussions.

Since you are new at IOT Analytics, I’ll explain our onboarding process for new clients.

Conduct research to become informed on the subject matter of the project. In this case, you will need to get up to speed on the domains of Smart Homes, sub-meters and household power consumption.
Identify any analytic skill/knowledge gaps foreseen for the project and plug those gaps with self-learning. With a data set this big, data munging and sub-setting will be essential to the analytic process. Working with DateTime and Time Series also needs to be mastered.
Perform an initial exploration of the data. This data exploration should be used to understand any potential issues, conduct early preprocessing and note summary statistics.
Hold a project kick-off meeting with the key stakeholders. This meeting will center around a presentation that contains all of the project details and our initial exploration of the data.
Your initial task is to work through the onboarding process and produce a PowerPoint presentation that will be delivered to the lead attorney’s team during the kick off meeting. This report will serve to help ensure a “meeting of the minds”, that everyone agrees to the scope and goals.

It is important to remember that we do not know what the data will show, and neither does the law firm; it is your job to tell them how we will conduct the analysis and what they are likely to learn, so be precise and accurate with your findings and any initial recommendations. However, keep in mind that you will be presenting your report to a non-technical audience at this stage.

The future of this project is in your capable hands! Gather the required resources and prove that the sub-metering devices will deliver the value the developer seeks through data analytics.
